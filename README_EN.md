-Fix Your Time!

Fix Your Time! is an educational game developed in Unity with the goal of teaching, in a visual and practical way, how the Cristian's algorithm works — a method used for clock synchronization in distributed systems.

-Purpose

To present a classic concept from the field of Distributed Systems in an accessible and interactive way, promoting learning through a playful and visual experience.

-What is Cristian's Algorithm?

It is a clock synchronization method for computer networks, in which a client estimates the server's time based on the round-trip time (RTT) of a message exchange.

-Game Features

> Digital clocks with configurable offsets
> RTT simulation with variable latency
> Step-by-step visual synchronization calculation
> Multilingual interface (Portuguese and English)
> 2D visual style with characters and environment

-Technologies Used

> Unity 2D
> C#
> TextMeshPro
> Unity Input System
